# Black-Scholes PINN with Symmetry and Unsupervised Learning

This repository presents a modified implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation, with a focus on unsupervised learning design.

The original codebase was developed by [Piero Paialunga](https://github.com/PieroPaialungaAI/BlackScholesPINN), and this version builds upon it with architectural and training refinements tailored for minimal data usage and enhanced PDE compliance.

## 🔍 What’s Different in This Version

- **Unsupervised PINN training**: No labeled data required — the solution is learned directly from the PDE and boundary/initial conditions.
- **Initial/terminal condition**:  
  

$
  C(S, T) = \max(S - K, 0)
$

  
  implemented via `np.maximum`, reflecting the exact payoff structure.
- **Boundary conditions**:
  - \( C(S_{\text{min}}, t) = 0 \)
  - \( C(S_{\text{max}}, t) = \text{Black-Scholes analytic solution} \)
- **Activation functions**:
  - `GELU` for smoother modeling the payoff (since it's a direct match).
- **Notebook-only workflow**: Training and evaluation are done entirely in a Jupyter notebook — no `main.py` or `train.py` scripts needed.

## 🧪 Why These Changes Matter

- Reduces reliance on synthetic or labeled data.
- Aligns the neural architecture with the financial structure of the problem.
- Improves interpretability and generalization by enforcing known boundary behavior.
- Makes the code easier to experiment with and extend via notebook-based workflows.
