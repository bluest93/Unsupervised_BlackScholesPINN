# Unsupervised Black-Scholes PINN

This repository presents a modified implementation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the Black-Scholes partial differential equation, with a focus on unsupervised learning and symmetry-aware design.

The original codebase was developed by [Piero Paialunga](https://github.com/PieroPaialungaAI/BlackScholesPINN). This version builds upon that foundation with architectural and training refinements aimed at minimizing data dependency and enhancing compliance with the PDE structure.

## Key Modifications

- **Unsupervised PINN training**  
  No labeled data is required — the solution is learned directly from the PDE and boundary/initial conditions.

- **Initial / Terminal condition**  
  - The terminal (or initial) condition is defined as $C(S, T) = \max(S - K, 0)$.

  - A **Neumann boundary condition** is applied at the upper boundary $S_{\max}$, enforcing $\partial C_\theta / \partial S = 1$, which is consistent with the asymptotic behavior of the option delta $N(d_1) \to 1$ for deep in-the-money call options.  
  Additionally, the analytic Black–Scholes solution at $S_{\max}$ has been tested  
  as an alternative upper boundary condition for comparison.

  - The **lower boundary condition** is simply $C(S_{\min}, t) = 0$,
  indicating that the option becomes worthless when the underlying stock price approaches zero.

- **Activation functions**
   - `GELU` is used for smooth approximation and improved gradient flow,  
    especially near the payoff kink at $t = T$.

- **Notebook-only workflow**  
  Training and evaluation are performed entirely within a Jupyter notebook — no `main.py` or `train.py` scripts are used.

## Why These Changes Matter

- Eliminates the need for synthetic or labeled data.
- Aligns solely with the financial structure of the problem, relying on the governing PDE.
- Improves generalization by enforcing known boundary behavior.

## How to Run

1. Open the notebook:
   ```
   BlackScholesModel.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells to train the PINN and visualize the results.

## Credits

This project is based on the original [BlackScholesPINN repository](https://github.com/PieroPaialungaAI/BlackScholesPINN) by **Piero Paialunga**, which provided a clean and modular framework for PINN-based option pricing. All modifications here are intended for research and educational purposes.
